STG Hall of Records

Each game is defined by the following properties:

* name: Name of the game
* company: Developer / Publisher
* entries: Score entries
* links: Links
* layout: Layout information

The following properties are available by default for each entry. Their values are game-dependent.

* player: Name of the player
* score: Score
* ship: Selected ship / character
* mode: Game mode / Difficulty (e.g. Original, Maniac, Normal, Expert, ...)
* weapon: Weapon / Style
* version: Version (1P, 2P, Japan, World, Old, New, ...)
* autofire: Flag whether autofire was used or not
* scored-date: Date the score was achieved (YYYY-MM-DD|YYYY-MM|YYYY)
* published-date: Date the score was published (YYYY-MM-DD|YYYY-MM|YYYY)
* source: Information source
* added-date: Date the score was added to the HoR
* comments: Additional comments
* links: Links to replay, Blog, ...
* image-url: URL pointing to a screenshot of the score

Additional properties may be specified. In this case the generator will treat their values verbatim.

For every property a property with the same name and a locale suffix can be specified. Its value will be used on the page in the corresponding language instead of the value of the original property. Currently only '-jp' for Japanese is used but this can be extended to support more languages.
